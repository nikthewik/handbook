## Overview

### The assignment

Creating an application equipped with a **search bar** that allows the user to find all the books in a specific category.

The application must contact the API of the external service Open Library to obtain the data of books in the searched category.

Upon the user's click on a book or a button, the app should be able to display the book's description by contacting another API of the Open Library service and passing the key of the selected book.

All additional features deemed necessary are allowed.

### Technologies used

- Parcel
- Semantic HTML
- CSS and SCSS
- JS
- Flexbox
- Responsive design
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Open Library API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/subjects)
